The Δδ 0.2′ values of copper injected Si0·2Ti0.25 and Si0·2Ti0.5 HEAs also similarly increased (302 MPa, 255 MPa) much because of the more bcc strengthening phase and brittle metallic compound phase contents (see Fig. 1 (c), (d)) and different contribution proportions of solid solution strengthening effects than that of arc melted Si0·2Ti0.25 and Si0·2Ti0.5 HEAs.
